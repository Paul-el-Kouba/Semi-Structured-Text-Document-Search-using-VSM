# Semi-Structured-Text-Document-Search-using-VSM

The goals of this project are: 
i) Implement a text document comparison function, which computes the similarity between two semi-structured (XML-like) text documents using a Vector Space Model (VSM-  based) approach, considering the structure and content properties of the documents.

ii) Implement a querying interface allowing the user to query a semi-structured text document collection, using keyword and semi-structured queries.

iii) Implement the needed indexing capabilities to speed-up the computation process when querying sets of documents. The project should also support the usage of the TED-based measure from project #1, as an alternative similarity computation measure to perform querying. 

iv) Compare the new VSM functionâ€™s time performance with the TED-based measure from project #1.
